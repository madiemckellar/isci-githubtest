# Creating symbols 

This is not very complex, just use HTML codes to create them 
* There are many lists of names that you can use to create things
* &alpha; This is an example 

# Subscript and superscripts 
CH<sub>4</sub>
&delta;<sup>18</sup>O

# Creating an equation 
This is just an extention of everything to put it all together

Like this example
* h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x)=&theta;<sub>o</sub>x+&theta;<sub>1</sub>x
